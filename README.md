# Course

Design a class called Course. The class  should contain:

○ The data ﬁelds courseName (String), numberOfStudents (int) and
courseLecturer (String).

○ A constructor that constructs a Course object with the speciﬁed
courseName, numberOfStudents and courseLecturer.

○ The relevant get and set methods for the data ﬁelds.

○ A toString() method that formats that returns a string that
represents a course object in the following format:
(courseName, courseLecturer, numberOfStudents)

Create a new ArrayList called courses1, add 5 courses to it and print it out.

Sort the List according to the numberOfStudents and print it out.

Swap the element at position 1 of the List with the element at position 2
and print it out.

Create a new ArrayList called courses2.

Using the addAll method add 5 courses to the courses2 List and print it
out.

Copy all of the courses from courses1 into courses2.

Add the following two elements to courses2:

○ (Java 101, Dr. P Green, 55)

○ (Advanced Programming, Prof. M Milton, 93)

Sort the courses in courses2 alphabetically according to the course name
and print it out.

Search for the course “Java 101” in courses2  and print out the index of the
course in the List.

Use the disjoint function to determine whether courses1 and courses2
have any elements in common and print out the result.

In courses2, ﬁnd the course with the most students and the course with
the least students and print each out.
